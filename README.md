# Software Architectures

This is a repo that consists bare minimum of software architecture and computational model implemented, so it can act as future reference for myself.
The repo also contains DSA helplines with UML diagram and pseudocode on readme and code itself (Implemented on Python and Golang) so it acts as a starter/reminder for someone new.
